abstract: |
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package for Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) that combines 
  deep learning with causal inference. It uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to 
  automatically learn temporal patterns such as adstock and lag, while simultaneously 
  discovering causal relationships between marketing channels through Directed Acyclic 
  Graph (DAG) learning. The package implements Hill equation-based saturation curves 
  to model diminishing returns and optimize budget allocation. Key features include 
  data-driven design, multi-region modeling, robust statistical methods, 
  comprehensive response curve analysis, and interactive visualizations.
